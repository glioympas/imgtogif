# Static images to an animated GIF image.

Users upload images and the app generates a GIF img. The image dimensions are based on the first image. 

## 3rd Party libraries</br>

* dropzone.js library for the drag and drop feature and POST requests to server.
* open source GifCreator class for the image proccessing part.


## Running immediately.
You don't need any migration to run the app , since it was created with the only goal to do that simple 'static to GIF' job.
